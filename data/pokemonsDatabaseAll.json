It is mostly green, with a grey diamond-shaped patch on its front. It is covered in armor and has a spiky ridge around its back and tail.\nIt is loosely based on a combination of various armored dinosaurs and the Tyrannosaurus Rex, however its main inspiration appears to be Kaiju creatures from ancient Japanese legends and pop culture, such as Godzilla.\nAlthough Tyranitar is Rock/Dark type, it evolves from Pupitar which is Rock/Ground type, thus loses its Ground type upon evolution - a rare occurrence for Pokémon.
